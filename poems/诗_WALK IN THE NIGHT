My soul is always bright
Take me to your dark night
My body is ever strong
Abandon evils from now on

My heart is still brave
It eagers a fierce love
My spirit is yet burning
Like a meteor in the evening

Then，please walk up to me
Let's rush in a starry stream
And never stop seeking the key
You'll find unseen stars gleam
