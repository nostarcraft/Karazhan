Let stars drop into black hairs
让星星掉进乌黑的秀发
Moonlight reflects，your eyes are pure and bright
月光扫过，你的眼睛清澈明亮
Let the sun sweep your clear cheek
让太阳滑入洁净的双颊
Clouds varnish it，your forehead is flush and smooth
白云粉饰，你的额头饱满光滑
Let me stay in your heart
让我钻到你的心窝里
Yearning grew into the net，caught me，and I struggled in vain
思念成网，困着我无力挣扎

I think it isn't your true appearance
我想，这不是你真实的容光
It is another appearance after your making up
是你妆后的另一种锋芒
After you faded，everything was lost
当你褪去所有的繁华
The simple street lamp suddenly murmured
连质朴的街灯也会突然说话
Then talking between light and shadow，our time——
于是光与暗的交谈间，我们的年华——
was dedicated to some acquaintance
偷偷献给了某个路人
or a little flower that quietly bloomed
或者悄悄绽放的小花

But you always keep smiling！Smile into the depth of my memory——
可你总在不停的笑啊！笑进我的记忆深处——
Your smile is like a gust of wind，how can I recognize you in the end of the world
你的浅笑好像一阵风，叫我如何分辨这天涯
And your smile is ever like dews in the wind，my tears hide under your pillow
但你的浅笑也曾似风中的露，我的眼泪偷偷藏在你枕下
