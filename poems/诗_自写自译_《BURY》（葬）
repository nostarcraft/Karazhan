Wind，take me the wet air
风，带来了潮湿空气
As you hair touch my face
如你发梢抚摸我的脸
A couple of stars is unknown and far
远处一对无名之星
Like eyes，without sake it cries
像眼睛，无端哭泣

My heart has sunk under water
我的心早已沉入水底
It goes into the earth dear
与大地深情地融为一体
If spring came with a suddenness
若春天会在意外中来临
Please wake me up by a flower
请用一朵小花将我唤起
