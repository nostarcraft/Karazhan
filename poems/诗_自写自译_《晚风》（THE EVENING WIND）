The sun is sinking

You come bouncing

Say “I'm back！”

At the yard no one is responsing

There are purple clouds
绛紫色的云﻿
and silent stars
静悄悄的星﻿
It blows my face with breeze
风儿抚摸着脸﻿
Tender and warm that is
柔嫩又温情﻿﻿

Do you hungry?
是不是饿了?﻿
What should I prepare today?

Let me call him

“Eh，Won't you come back?”

The wind is with a trace of coolness
风儿带着一丝凉意﻿
Do murmur
喃喃细语﻿
Maybe tomorrow is fine weather
明天也许又是一个晴天吧……
