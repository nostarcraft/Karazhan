Happy time，happy time，we ever long the happy time
In memory of the lost childhood，have a gathering with wine.

What a shyness and what a smile
Couldn't we recongnize，and time quickly goes by
What a silence and what a glimpse
No one find your faint eyes

Happy time，happy time，our youth goes by
Dream seems out of reach，but keep your spirit high

What a secret and what a night
Conceal that in bright moonlight
What a honor and what a wonder
Failure，we will never remember

Happy time，happy time，our friendship continues forever
Binary stars shine each other，make it eternally pure
